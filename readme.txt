A novel machine learning paradigm called the Generative Adversarial Tri-Model (GAT) method is proposed to incorporate analytical knowledge into neural network through an interesting positive-sum strategy. It can be implemented to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with arbitrary definite conditions. It successfully solves a human body oscillation recovery problem. This project is the source code of GAT method experiments. For details of the GAT method, please refer to the paper "Machine Learning based on a Generative Adversarial Tri-Model".

The "Application of the GAT method in solving ODEs" directory contains the source code for the four ODE solving problems in paper. The "Application of the GAT method in human balancing evaluation" directory contains the balance sensor raw data and source code for human body motion recovery experiments. Inside, the "pressure_brightness_mapping.mat" contains the mapping relationship between pixel value and pressure for the balance sensor video data, which is in matlab format. The script "solve human body motion with GAT method.py" can recovery human body motion for all the four human experiments in paper (from the 13th to 16th line, uncomment an appropriate line to choose which video data to load).
